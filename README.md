# Astrophysics Python Training

This repository documents my progression from scientific Python foundations to research-ready astrophysics data analysis and simulations.

## Structure

 - Level 1 (Foundations) : Numpy/SciPy/Matplotlib + numerical physics mini-projects
 - Level 2 (Astrophysics) : Astropy, FITS, coordinates, Gaia/SDSS data access
 - Level 3 (Statistics) : Bayesian inference, MCMC, astro data modelling
 - Level 4 (Simulations) : N-body, structure formation toy models, computational methods

## Goal

Build a reproducible portfolio of projects that demonstrate computational astrophysics skills relevant for MSc/PhD research.
